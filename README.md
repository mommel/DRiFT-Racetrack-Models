I myself don't own such a racer, but for a friend I was already in some design process. But I think this could be a really fun project for the Hacktoberfest. Having fun in constructions, other in drifting after printing.

So I will take own of the often used rollable maps e.g. SPA and construct the assets for that track.
Everybody can contribute.
